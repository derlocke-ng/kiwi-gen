# ü•ù Kiwi Key Generator

Kiwi Key Generator is a browser-based tool for generating SSH keys and SSL certificates locally, without sending any data to external servers. It provides a clean, user-friendly interface for cryptographic operations that are typically performed via command line tools.

## ‚ú® Features

### SSH Key Generation
- Generate RSA, Ed25519, and ECDSA keys
- Configurable key sizes (2048-bit, 4096-bit for RSA)
- Optional passphrase protection
- Automatic key comment generation
- One-click download of private and public keys

### SSL Certificate Generation
- Create self-signed Certificate Authority (CA)
- Generate SSL certificates signed by your CA
- Support for wildcard certificates (*.domain.com)
- DES3 encryption option for private keys
- Upload existing CA for certificate signing

## üîß Usage

### Option 1: Open directly in a browser
1. Clone or download this repository
2. Open `index.html` in any modern web browser
3. That's it! No installation or server required

### Option 2: Run with a local web server
If you prefer to use a local web server:

```bash
# Navigate to the kiwi-gen directory
cd kiwi-gen

# Option A: Using Python's built-in HTTP server
python -m http.server 8000

# Option B: Using Python 3
python3 -m http.server 8000
```

Then open your browser and navigate to: `http://localhost:8000`

## üíª How It Works

Kiwi Key Generator uses the [Forge](https://github.com/digitalbazaar/forge) JavaScript library to perform all cryptographic operations directly in your browser. Your keys and certificates never leave your device, ensuring maximum security.

### SSH Key Generation Process
1. Select the key type (RSA, Ed25519, or ECDSA)
2. Choose the bit size (for RSA and ECDSA)
3. Optionally add a passphrase for encryption
4. Click "Generate SSH Key"
5. Download your private and public keys

### SSL Certificate Generation Process
1. Create a Certificate Authority (CA) or upload an existing one
2. Enter the domain name for your certificate
3. Click "Create Certificate"
4. Download your certificate, private key, and CA certificate


## üõ†Ô∏è Development

Kiwi Key Generator is built with vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, with no build steps or complex dependencies. It uses the Forge.js library for cryptographic operations.

### Offline Usage

By default, the application uses forge.min.js from a CDN. For complete offline usage, you can download the library locally:

1. **Manual Method**:
   - Download forge.min.js from https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/node-forge@1.3.1/dist/forge.min.js
   - Save it to your project directory
   - Update the script tag in index.html to use the local file:
     ```html
     <script src="forge.min.js"></script>
     ```

2. **Bash One-liner**:
   ```bash
   # Download forge.min.js and update index.html in one command
   curl -o forge.min.js https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/node-forge@1.3.1/dist/forge.min.js && sed -i 's|https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/node-forge@1.3.1/dist/forge.min.js|forge.min.js|g' index.html
   ```
